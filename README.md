Rational Numbers Calculator Algorithm

1. Begin the main function.
2. Write an indefinite while loop that will run until the user decides to leave the program.
3. In the while loop, invoke inputRules function to show the input rules to the user.
4. Ask the user if they want to calculate or to exit the program. Choose the option from the input.
undefined
a. Tell the user to enter 2 rational numbers with an operator between them. Read the user's input.
b. If the input is valid, call the isValid function with the input as an argument.
c. If the input is valid, go for extracting the numerator1, numerator2, denominator1, denominator2, and the operation from the input string.
d. Turn the numerator and denominator strings into integers by using the stoll function.
Step e. According to the operation, call the function (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) with the numerator and denominator as the arguments.
g. Display the outcome to the user.
h. Proceed to the next iteration of the while loop.
undefined
a. Show a message that the program is about to terminate.
b. Break out of the while loop to terminate the program.
undefined
a. Show a message that instructs the user to enter a valid choice.
8. End Main function .
